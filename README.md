# Description

This project was the fourth assignment I completed in the course. By doing this assignment, I got to know the Polish notation that solves equations efficiently, became well aware of the importance of algorithms, and also implemented the work of reading from an equation file and writing the results to another. There are also unit tests.

## Task
```
Implement two modes for application "Calculator":

1) Users work in a console application with simple operations. Operations should be executed with math priority (* / + -)

Examples:

Input -> Output
"2+2*3" -> "8"
"2/0" -> Exception. Divide by zero.

2) Work with files. Application read data from file line by line. Implement calculation with brackets. Each line shoud be calculated abd the result written to a different file.

Example:

Input file
1+2*3(3+2)
1+x+4
2+15/3+4*2

Output file
1+2*3(3+2) = 11
1+x+4 = Exception. Wrong input.
2+15/3+4*2 = 2+15/3+4*2 = 15
```
## Features:
- Two modes of operation

  - Console 
  - From file to file
- Support for degree, parenthesis, and basic mathematical operations
- Error handling
